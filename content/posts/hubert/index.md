Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth (born April 9, 2841), better known as Professor Farnsworth, Professor or just Farnsworth, is the chief executive officer and a shareholder of Planet Express and the tetragonist of Futurama.

He is pushing the limits of even the 31st Century at an ag–µ of well over 160. Professor Farnsworth is one of six living relatives of Philip J. Fry, together with his own clone, Cubert J. Farnsworth, as well as his only son by means of his sexual relations with Carol Miller while he worked for her, Igner. He has a brother named Floyd, also his parents Velma and Ned Farnsworth are still alive. He is Fry's nephew thirty times removed.

Though never stated, it's likely he is the descendant of Yancy Fry, Jr, through Yancy's only known child Philip J. Fry II named after his uncle. However, since it's revealed that Fry is his own grandfather and therefore Yancy's grandfather, as well as Philip II's great-grandfather, due to his time-traveling exploits, Professor Farnsworth is logically, in fact, Fry's direct descendant via his brother/grandson/great-uncle Yancy Jr. and nephew/great-grandson Philip II. So the six include: himself, Cubert, Igner, Floyd, Velma, and Ned.
