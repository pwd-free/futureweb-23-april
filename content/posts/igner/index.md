Igner (born December 13, 2979) is the youngest and most pitiful of Mom's three sons. His older half brothers are Walt and Larry. Like them he owns a 0.1% share in MomCorp. His intelligence is extremely low and he often displays symptoms of mental disability. He speaks in a moronic voice, and is often found saddled with the worst tasks by his brothers: being bullied into wearing Mom's bra and playing the part of Pamela Anderson's body for her head in a jar. His immaturity means he gets disgusted easy and he has a tendency to repeat what he hears without full comprehension, for example: in Bender's Game, Igner repeats the phrase "We're owl exterminators" twice and pronounces exterminators wrong.

In Bender's Game, Igner helps Turanga Leela, Philip J. Fry I and Hubert J. Farnsworth escape his pursuing brothers, by denying that he had seen anybody to Walt. However, while everybody else was going along with the Dungeons & Dragons/Lord of the Rings parody, Igner's alternate reality persona (Ignus) got confused, pulled out a lightsaber, and started parodying Star Wars.

It was revealed in Bender's Game that Igner is the son of Professor Farnsworth, making him the distant nephew of Fry and half-brother of Cubert J. Farnsworth, while his older half-brothers have so far been assumed as the sons of Mom and another unknown male.

Due to Fry's and Leela's marriage in "Meanwhile", Igner is the distant nephew and step-grandson of Leela (since The Fry Family and The Turanga Family are the in-law family members of Fry and Leela).
