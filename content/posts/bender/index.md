Bender Bending Rodr√≠guez, (born September 4, 2996), designated Bending Unit 22, and commonly known as Bender, is a bending unit created by a division of MomCorp in Tijuana, Mexico, and his serial number is 2716057.[1] His mugshot id number is 01473. He is Fry's best friend.

Bender drinks copious amounts of alcohol to recharge his fuel cells, while displaying symptoms similar to intoxication when he stops drinking, even sporting "five o'clock rust" around his mouth area.

Bender regularly emits "flaming burps," and "sometimes they aren't "burps". He gambles, smokes cigars, consorts with hookerbots, and has 100,000 terabytes of porn on his hard drive.[2]

He's constantly trying to gain attention, apparently to maintain his already over-inflated ego. He is equipped with Gaydar,[3] though it typically indicates that everyone is gay. He hates his "self-destruct sequence."[4]

He lives with Fry in his closet-sized apartment, fully equipped with an apartment-sized closet.

He has an affinity for turtles (as they both can't get off their back), penguins, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Bender was made Pharaoh on the planet O'Cyris IV, but his servants, fed up with inhumane treatment, sent him to his grave (before he actually died).

Bender is also fascinated with cooking, though he is shown to have no sense of actual human taste, often creating dishes that can even kill plant life. He also thinks that humans eat rocks. Magnets, when attached to his head, causing him to lose his sense of inhibition and act like a folk singer. Bender has also stolen his best friend Fry's kidney.
